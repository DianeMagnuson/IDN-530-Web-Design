	 <h2>Fractions</h2>
	 <br>
<p><strong>P</strong>ercents are fractions, meaning they are parts of a whole. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>F</strong>or Example: if you ate 2 slices of pizza, you ate <em>part</em> of that whole pizza.
	<br>
	<br>
<strong>N</strong>ow, depending on how many slices that whole pizza was cut into, determines
the fraction, or percent, of that pizza you ate.
<br>
<br>
<strong>L</strong>et's say that pizza was cut evenly into 8 pieces.<br>
<br>
<strong>T</strong>hen, let's say you ate 2 of those pieces.<br>
<br>
<strong>H</strong>ow much did you eat? <br>
<br>
<strong>Y</strong>ou ate: <em>2 out of 8 pieces.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>I</strong>n fraction form, this is written as: 2/8. </p>

<h2>Percents</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>L</strong>earn more about percentages here: <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/percents/introduction-to-percentages/1/">Percentages</a>
<br>
<br>
The <strong>whole</strong> = eating <strong>all</strong> of the pizza. <br>
<br>
Since it was cut into 8 total pieces of pizza, that means, <br>
if you ate 8 of the slices, you ate <strong>ALL</strong> of the pizza. <br>
<br>
In percent, that is written as: <strong>100%.</strong>
<br>
<p><strong>H</strong>owever, since you only ate <em>two of those pieces</em> you ate 2/8 of it. <br>
<br>
2/8 is <strong>one serving</strong> because 4 people are eating, so there are 4 servings. <br>
<br>
<strong>T</strong>herefore, since you are one of 4 people eating, you ate 1/4 of the pizza.
<br>
<br>
<strong>In money terms:</strong> 1/4 = one quarter (or $.25 cents.)  <br>
<br>
Move the decimal 2 places to the right: .25 = 25. <br>
Doing this gives you 25% of the pizza! <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Here's another tip:</strong><br>
	Think</strong> of percents as <strong>money!</strong> The whole represents $1.00. <br>
<br>
<strong>T</strong>hat means the pizza, divided into 8 equal pieces, is = to $1.00. <br>
If each person gets 2 pieces, you can feed 4 people. <br>
<br>
<strong>T</strong>hinking of this as money, exchange <em>people</em> for <em>coins.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Think:</strong> 4 quarters = $1.00. Each person eats $.25 <br>
or 1 quarter of the pizza. <strong>One quarter</strong> is written as: <strong>25%!</strong>
<ul>
    <li> Pennies: 100 pennies = $1.00, so 1 penny = 1% </li>
    <li> Nickels: 20 nickels = $1.00, so 1 nickel = 5% </li>
    <li> Dimes: 10 dimes = $1.00, so 1 dime = 10% </li>
    <li> Quarters: 4 quarters = $1.00, so 1 quarter = 25% </li>
