  <h2>Gratuities</h2>
	<p> <strong>M</strong>any service workers are paid <em>below</em> minimum wages due to
		the practice of customers tipping their servers based on service quality. Businesses
		with workers relying on tips as their income include: restaurant servers, bar tenders, drivers, pet groomers,
		food delivery workers, hair stylists and hospitality workers (bell-hops, cleaning dept. room service).</p>
	<p>
		<br>
		<strong>T</strong>he current tipping rate for quality service is 20%. This means for good service, a fair tip
	  for a $10 bill would be $2.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br>
		<strong>H</strong>ere is a quick way to determine the tip on any bill:<br>
		<br>
		1. <strong>Move decimal point</strong> of total on bill <strong>one place to the left.</strong> That new amount is 10%.
		(For Example: my hair cut bill is $24.95. That is almost $25 so <strong>I round up to $25,</strong> and then move decimal
		1 place to the left: <strong>$2.50</strong>). <br>
		<br>
		2. $2.50 is only 10% of my bill. I want to give my stylist a <strong>20%</strong> So, I quickly <strong>double</strong>
			$2.50 in my head, making it now 20% which amounts to <strong>$5.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<br>
		<strong>L</strong>et's say I wanted to give a <strong>15%</strong> tip. Again, I would: <br>
		<br>
		1. Round up total on bill to nearest dollar: <br>
		<br>
		2. Move the decimal point one place to the left for 10%. <br>
		<br>
		3. But this time, I need to <strong>half</strong> the 10% amount: <br>
		<br>
		4. Combine the 10% and 5% to make 15%. 10% of $25 is $2.50. Half of $2.50 is $1.25. <strong>15% = $3.75!</strong>
