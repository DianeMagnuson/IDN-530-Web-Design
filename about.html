	<h2>About Me</h2><br>
	<br>
<img src="Me 2021.jpg"alt="Me">
	<br>
	<p>  <strong>I</strong> am a former teacher and Instructional Design student at Quinnipiac University.
		   I have created this website using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
			 for my final project. I also volunteer at a nonprofit, homeless support organization for youth ages 18 to 24
		   in my community. <br>
			 <br>
			 <strong>O</strong>ver the past 3 years as a volunteer, I have learned that for most homeless youth,
		   gaining reliable and dependable employment is <em>crucial,</em> and that it is not
		   possible to obtain housing security without this steady income. Homeless youth
			 are often employed, but at places where workers are frequently sent home and do
			 not provide consistency of hours needed to gain regular income or benefits. Also,
		   for young adults who are parents, steady employment also provides the ability to
		   care for their children. <br>
			 <br>
			 <strong>S</strong>ince most jobs require at least some math skills, potential employers usually
			 require candidates to complete a mental math test as part of the application
			 process. Therefore, many of our disadvantaged youth request additional help
			 from their mentors so that they can complete these pre-employment exams
			 successfully, opening doors to more steady and reliable income.

   <p> <strong>T</strong>he goal of this website is to help young adults overcome the hurdle of gaining steady
			 employment by boosting mental math skills which are needed to successfully apply for,
			 and be considered for most regular employment opportunities. <br>
			 <br>
			 <strong>B</strong>y using well-researched learning design principles combined with adult learning theory,
			 content and lessons specifically target the adult audience. This is a much needed resource
			 since most apps that teach mental math skills are geared towards elementary aged children
			 and teens. <br>
       <br>
			 <strong>R</strong>esearch shows that adults respond best to learning that is specifically geared to them.
			 Adult learning apps should be <em>multi-media-based, intuitively designed, contain relevance,</em>
			 be <em>immediately applicable</em> and also needs to be <em>learner-directed.</em> Finally, unlike mentors,
			 websites are <em> available 24/7</em> and <em>responsive.</em> <p> <br>
