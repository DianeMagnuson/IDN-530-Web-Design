	  <h2>What is Estimation</h2><br>
 	  <br>
	  <p> <strong>H</strong>ave you ever seen something priced, $18.95 and thought,
		"That item costs about $20?" What you were doing was <em>estimating</em> the cost
		of that item including the additional cost of sales tax. <br>
		<br>
	  <strong>Estimating</strong> is something we do all the time! We estimate how
		much gas we need in our cars and how long it will take to get somewhere. We estimate
		how much our bills will cost and how much we will have left-over for fun. We estimate
		the size of things such as clothing, space in the trunk for suitcases or groceries.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>A</strong>t first, we may estimate inaccurately, such as trying to park in a space that's a bit
		too small. But we quickly learn to estimate better from these experiences!<br>
		<br>
		<strong>W</strong>e can also use <em>strategies</em> to help us become better estimators.
		Many jobs require us to be able to estimate mathmatically to discover mistakes,
		even if we dont know the exact answer.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>F</strong>or example: Let's say a cashier totaled my grocery items: $70.97.
		Before checking out, I had  rounded prices of each item which total about $50. I have
		the cashier double check each item's costs and it's discovered that the regular prices
		for on sale items were totaled instead. Thanks to estimation, I saved about $20! <br>

	  <h2>Rounding Rules to Remember: </h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		1. If the number is 5 or above, round up! <br>
		<br>
		2. If the number is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, round down! <br>
		<br>
		(For Example: by rounding to the <strong>nearest dollar</strong>, $1.99 becomes $2, but $1.49 becomes $1.00)
