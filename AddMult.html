<h2>Add Left to Right</h2>
<p><br>
<strong>O</strong>ften, math problems are written horizontally on job applications. This is because
	the employer wants you to see that you can do the math in your head. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>T</strong>he following short video (on the right) demonstrates how to solve two-digit addition problems from <strong>left-to-right</strong>
	starting with the highest place-value, rather than solving the problem right-to-left, which involves
	the need to work it out on paper and <em>carrying</em> to the next place value.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Mental Multiplication</h2>
	<p><strong>T</strong>here are several ways to mentally compute multi-digit multiplication
			problems in your head, depending on the type or complexity of the problem.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>F</strong>or Example: Knowing that multiplying any number by 0 results in 0 helps
			you to multiply any numbers that end with 0 quickly. <br>
			<br>
			(If this confuses you, Remember: the multiplication symbol: x, stands for the word "of.")<br>
			<br>
			<strong>S</strong>o a multiplication sentence such as "3 x 6" can
			be read as, <em>"Three groups <em>of</em> six."</em> <br>
			<br>
			<strong>L</strong>ikewise, 0 X 42 can be read as, "Zero groups of forty-two."<br>
			<br>
			<strong>U</strong>sing these terms clearly demonstrate that zero groups of any number will always be zero (and vice-versa).
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>A</strong> problem like: 120 x 60 can be done quickly in your head as follows:<br>
			<br>
			1. Eliminate the 0s (Only if they are at the end!) <br>
			<br>
			2. Solve the rest of the problem: 12 x 6 = 72. <br>
			<br>
			3. Put the # of 0's you took out back in the answer at the end: <br>
			<br>
			12<strong>0</strong> x 6<strong>0</strong> = 72<strong>00</strong>
			<br>

		<h2>Multiplication is Repeated Addition</h2>
		<p> When you multiply two numbers, you are really just adding them repeatedly. For Example: 3 x 4 is the
			same as "Three groups of four." It looks like this: <strong>4 + 4 + 4 = 12).</strong> It is much easier
			to do this: <strong>3 x 4 = 12.</strong>
