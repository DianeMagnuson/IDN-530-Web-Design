	<p>I am very excited to be in IDN 530 and will be using this template to get myself started.</p>

	<h1> My Biography for Module Two </h1>

	<h2> Where I'm From & Places I've Lived </h2>
	<img src="selfie2021.jpg">
<p> I grew up in Chicago, and moved to Los Angeles where my husband got a job. We lived there
		for seven years and started a family. We decided to move back closer to both our families and
		relocated to where we are now, in St. Cloud, Minnesota. </p>

<h2> About My Career </h2>
<p> I finished my BS Degree in Education at St. Cloud State University and have been a teacher
		 here for about twenty years. In 2019, I decided to gain new challenges and experiences by
		 moving into technology and Instructional Design. I will be finished with my QU MS in
		 Instructional Design at end of this coming fall of 2021. </p>

<h2> Learning Cool Things at QU! </h2>
<p> I have learned many cool things since beginning my student experience here at Quinnipiac.
	I find attaining the newest information and research on learners exciting, but most
	would probably say that learning the new technology and how to design the best digital
	Learning experiences would probably be the tops. It is hard to argue about that. I have
	learned about LMS platforms, design elements and features, how to use Adobe Captivate,
	as well as UDL and even a bit about future learning technologies such as Augmented
	and Virtual Realities. Right now I am learning how to use HTML and CSS to create
	a website. I have really enjoyed my educational journey here at Quinnipiac.

<p><strong>Mountain Devils Attack Miners</strong>
<br>
<p> On July 13, 1924, the Oregonian, a Portland daily newspaper, reported that a group of five miners,
		prospecting on the southeastern slopes of Mount Saint Helens in Washington State, had been
		attacked in their cabin by a group of <blockquote> "Mountain Devils."</blockquote>
		The story later came to be known as the <blockquote>"The Ape Canyon Incident,"</blockquote> named after the
		gorge where the attack took place and where gorilla-like creatures had been seen for as long
		as anyone could remember.</p>
		<cite>The Orgonian July 14,1924 </cite>
<br>
<p>By the way, a <dfn>Mountain Devil</dfn> is also known as <em>Bigfoot</em> or <em>Sasquatch</em>
<br>
<p>Early Sasquatch investigators found and interviewed the last surviving member of that drama,
		Fred Beck, after digging up the old Oregonian article in the mid-1960s.
		Beck told them the assault on the cabin came in response to the prospectors firing on creatures that
		had been shadowing them in the woods for several days.
		The account of the cabin attack, which came in the dead of night and continued in unrelenting waves
		until daylight, is worthy of its own horror film!
		The mob of ape-men swarmed the outside of the cabin, banging on its door and walls, stomping on the roof,
		pelting it with rocks, and reaching in with their shaggy arms through gaps in the logs.
		The terrified miners barely kept the creatures at bay, firing their rifles at the walls and ceiling
		all night, until the attack finally came to an end with the rising sun.The Oregonian reported that the
		miners <blockquote>"were so upset by the incidents of the night, they left the cabin without making breakfast."
		</blockquote> The forest ranger who was assigned to that district, and who claimed to have met the men as they
		were fleeing, later told investigators, in the 1960s, that <blockquote> "he had never seen grown men more frightened."</blockquote>
