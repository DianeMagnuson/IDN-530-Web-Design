	<h1> Hi, my name is Diane Magnuson. </h1>
	<p>I am very excited to be in IDN 530 and will be using this template to get myself started.</p>

	<h1> My Biography for Module Two </h1>

	<h2> Where I'm From & Places I've Lived </h2>
	<p> I grew up in Chicago, and moved to Los Angeles where my husband got a job. We lived there
		for seven years and started a family. We decided to move back closer to both our families and
		 relocated to where we are now, in St. Cloud, Minnesota. </p>

<h2> About My Career </h2>
<p> I finished my BS Degree in Education at St. Cloud State University and have been a teacher
		 here for about twenty years. In 2019, I decided to gain new challenges and experiences by
		 moving into technology and Instructional Design. I will be finished with my QU MS in
		 Instructional Design at end of this coming fall of 2021. </p>

<h2> Learning Cool Things at QU! </h2>
<p> I have learned many cool things since beginning my student experience here at Quinnipiac.
	I find attaining the newest information and research on learners exciting, but most
	would probably say that learning the new technology and how to design the best digital
	Learning experiences would probably be the tops. It is hard to argue about that. I have
	learned about LMS platforms, design elements and features, how to use Adobe Captivate,
	as well as UDL and even a bit about future learning technologies such as Augmented
	and Virtual Realities. Right now I am learning how to use HTML and CSS to create
	a website. I have really enjoyed my educational journey here at Quinnipiac.
